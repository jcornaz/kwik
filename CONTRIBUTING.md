## Ask for help, feature or report a bug

Feel free to create feature request and bug report in the [issues](https://github.com/jcornaz/kwik/issues).
Only make sure that your request/report is not a duplicate of an exiting one.

## Choose an issue to work on

Issue marked [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/jcornaz/kwik/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22) are supposed to be easy and isolated enough to be done by anyone having interest in contributing.

I assign myself to the isue to signal on what I am working at the moment. So you can safely pick any [unassigned issue](https://github.com/jcornaz/kwik/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee+).

You may (but don't have to) write a message in the issue to say you are working on it.


## Build from source

Make sure that the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` point to a JDK installation (version 11 or newer)

This project use a standard [gradle](https://gradle.org/) setup. Here are the most important tasks you may want to run:

* `./gradlew check` Build and test/check everything (Best first task for a fresh clone).
* `./gradlew test` Compile sources and run unit tests
* `./gradlew sphinx` Generate documentation (result will be in `build/site/index.html`)
* `./gradlew detekt` Run a static code analysis and report code smells (may fail if too many code smells are found)


## Coding standard

Follow the [Kotlin conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)

Run the static code analysis (`./gradlew detekt`) to get a reports of the code smells.

* Make sure it passes the build (run `./gradlew check`)
* Write a description
  * explaining what problem is solved (with a reference to an existing issue if applicable)
  * helping to read and understand the code changes
  * pointing parts that requires special attention or consideration
* Update documentation if necessary
  * Documentation sources are in folder `docs`
  * you can generate it locally with `./gradlew sphinx`
